  Hi, my name's <mark>Lucien</mark>! I'm a PhD candidate in the SNSF Eccellenza Team of Prof. Dr. Kevin Reuter, at the Department of Philosophy, University of Zurich. My research concerns normativity in language, and more specifically <mark>dual character concepts</mark> and <mark>normative generics</mark>. Most of my work is situated in <mark>theoretical philosophy</mark>, but it also profits from empirical work in experimental philsophy. I'm a well-versed <mark>data scientist</mark>, specialized in data acquisition and computational linguistics. The interdisciplinary character of my work offers new perspectives on perennial philosophical questions. It also allows for bottom-up approach to conceptual engineering, based on natural language data. And most importantly, <mark>it's fun</mark>!

        title: The Dual Character Concept Approach to Normative Generics

          Normative generics, such as the rebuke "Boys donâ€™t cry.", are ubiquitous in everyday-language.
          But what exactly makes them normative? Among the most recent explanations are Dual Character
          Concepts. While the DCC framework works well for lexical norms in social kind generics,
          it cannot account for context-dependent normative interpretations of generics. This paper
          shows that the conditions for dual character normativity can be generalized from concepts to expressions
          in order to eliminate this blind-spot.

          Philosophers and linguists currently lack the means to reliably identify evaluative concepts and to measure these concepts'
          evaluative intensity. Using a corpus-based approach, we present two new methods that allow us to distinguish evaluatively thick
          adjectives like 'courageous' from descriptive adjectives like 'tall', and from value-associated adjectives like 'sunny'.

          How evaluative are legal texts? Do legal professionals speak a more descriptive or perhaps a more evaluative language? In this paper, we present the results of a corpus study in which we examined the use of evaluative language in both the legal domain as well as public discourse.

          Voat was an American alt-tech news aggregator and social networking service, created in 2014 and  shut down on Christmas 2020. It was infamously known to be a home to hate speech, alt-right content, racism and misogyny. Due to its shutdown, the discourse on Voat is closed and sealed, and  thus constitutes an important artifact for the research on hate speech. As an effort to make Voat-data easily and openly available for research, I'm creating a comprehensive Voat-corpus along with a preliminary analysis of its content.

          Digitalization is fundamentally changing science and society. The Digital Society Initiative (DSI) at the University of Zurich offers an Excellence Program for new and beginning PhD students interested in the digital transformation. As a complementary curriculum to a doctoral program, general doctorate or doctoral subject, it prepares students of all disciplines for a world in which interdisciplinary collaboration is a top priority for tackling digitalization topics. In a cross-disciplinary environment, PhD students build up and expand interdisciplinary thinking and skills as well as digital competences at the highest level in the disciplines affected by digitalization.

            The Digital Democracy Lab researches the implications of digital technology for politics and democracy using computational social science methods. It provides a research infrastructure that enables efficient, scalable, and replicable data collection and analysis. Key areas of research are political communication and public opinion, e-government and public administration, AI and governance, civic tech and political participation, the regulation of tech platforms, and state repression and surveillance. I was tasked with frontend production and data mining projects.

            Twitter data can help to analyze military combat actions from the perspective of civilians trapped in disputed zones. As part of this project, I was tasked with geomapping tweets to analyze gender-based violence in the civil war. As part of this project, I developed a <a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lucienbaumgartner/helper/blob/master/r/reverse-geocoding/readme.html">KD-tree based reverse geocoder in R</a>, emulating the reverseGeocoder python library.

          Data-driven journalism has become mainstay for open source and accountable news reporting in the age of fake news. The NZZ has a young and engaged team that focuses on long-format analyses and background articles as live monitoring of events. As an intern, I co-organized the coverage 2017 German Bundestagswahl, and wrote articles about various topics, such as the legalization of marijuana in the US, or the most controversial movies of all time.
