  Hi, my name's <mark>Lucien</mark>! I'm a PhD candidate in the SNSF Eccellenza Team of Prof. Dr. Kevin Reuter, at the Department of Philosophy, University of Zurich. My research concerns normativity in language, and more specifically <mark>dual character concepts</mark> and <mark>normative generics</mark>. Most of my work is situated in <mark>theoretical philosophy</mark>, but it also profits from empirical work in experimental philsophy. I'm a well-versed <mark>data scientist</mark>, specialized in data acquisition and computational linguistics. The interdisciplinary character of my work offers new perspectives on perennial philosophical questions. It also allows for bottom-up approach to conceptual engineering, based on natural language data. And most importantly, <mark>it's fun</mark>!

          Normative generics, such as the rebuke "Girls don't play football.", are ubiquitous in everyday language. But what exactly makes them normative? A popular explanation highlights the role of Dual Character Concepts (DCCs). However, while the DCC framework works well for lexical norms in social kind-generics, it cannot account for context-dependent normative interpretations of generics. This paper shows that the conditions for dual character norms can be generalized from concepts to expressions (DCEs) in order to eliminate this blind-spot. Instead of focusing on explanations limited to social kinds (e.g. idealized social functions), I suggest an approach based on linguistic features, namely definitional generics, and specific inference patterns. From this analysis, we learn that dual character is not restricted to certain social and artifact kinds, but can also occur <i>ad hoc</i>. As long as the stage is set right, we can formulate dual character norms about almost any kind-property relation. My considerations thus offer a new explanatory framework for both normative generics and DCCs more generally, and ultimately question the centrality of <i>lexical</i> norms.

        title: "Could I be a giraffe?": Figurative Elements in Dual Character Classifications
        caption: single author
        description: |
          Dual character concepts like <i>artist</i> or <i>magician</i> have a descriptive and normative dimension, which are considered to be independent of each other. Their normative dimension is generally assumed to be univocal and only indicative of literal classifications. Contrary to this conception, I argue that dual character classifications include figurative elements. I suggest to conceptualize dual character classifications as a lexical-pragmatic process involving sense broadening and narrowing, rather than as a genuine natural kind. These processes include metaphor and hyperbole as forms of category extension. This ultimately means that normative dual character classifications are much more complex and widespread than accepted hitherto.

        title: Why are reckless socks not (more of) a thing? Towards an empirical classification of evaluative concepts
        caption: single author
        description: |
          Many scholars suggest there to be different evaluative concept classes, namely thin and thick concepts. To this date, hardly any empirical evidence exists on how to distinguish these two classes. In this paper, I propose new empirical classifiers for evaluative concepts, such as <i>disgusting</i> or <i>honest</i>, based on quantitative corpus linguistics. This article builds on prior work in experimental philosophy which has shown that sentiment analysis can be used to track differences between concept classes. Specifically, this study investigates whether the relationship between sentiment and evaluativeness is more aptly captured by a linear or a higher degree parabolic function. It also shows that adjectives attributed to animate entities (e.g. "<i>generous</i> customer") generally have a higher probability to be evaluative concepts than those attributed to inanimate entities (e.g. "<i>dry</i> soil"). Overall, these classifiers offer new avenues for the empirical classification of evaluative concepts.

        description: |
          Philosophers and linguists currently lack the means to reliably identify evaluative concepts and to measure these concepts'
          evaluative intensity. Using a corpus-based approach, we present two new methods that allow us to distinguish evaluatively thick
          adjectives like 'courageous' from descriptive adjectives like 'tall', and from value-associated adjectives like 'sunny'.

          How evaluative are legal texts? Do legal professionals speak a more descriptive or perhaps a more evaluative language? In this paper, we present the results of a corpus study in which we examined the use of evaluative language in both the legal domain as well as public discourse.

          Voat was an American alt-tech news aggregator and social networking service, created in 2014 and  shut down on Christmas 2020. It was infamously known to be a home to hate speech, alt-right content, racism and misogyny. Due to its shutdown, the discourse on Voat is closed and sealed, and  thus constitutes an important artifact for the research on hate speech. As an effort to make Voat-data easily and openly available for research, I'm creating a comprehensive Voat-corpus along with a preliminary analysis of its content.

          Digitalization is fundamentally changing science and society. The Digital Society Initiative (DSI) at the University of Zurich offers an Excellence Program for new and beginning PhD students interested in the digital transformation. As a complementary curriculum to a doctoral program, general doctorate or doctoral subject, it prepares students of all disciplines for a world in which interdisciplinary collaboration is a top priority for tackling digitalization topics. In a cross-disciplinary environment, PhD students build up and expand interdisciplinary thinking and skills as well as digital competences at the highest level in the disciplines affected by digitalization.

            The Digital Democracy Lab researches the implications of digital technology for politics and democracy using computational social science methods. It provides a research infrastructure that enables efficient, scalable, and replicable data collection and analysis. Key areas of research are political communication and public opinion, e-government and public administration, AI and governance, civic tech and political participation, the regulation of tech platforms, and state repression and surveillance. I was tasked with frontend production and data mining projects.

          Data-driven journalism has become mainstay for open source and accountable news reporting in the age of fake news. The NZZ has a young and engaged team that focuses on long-format analyses and background articles as live monitoring of events. As an intern, I co-organized the coverage 2017 German Bundestagswahl, and wrote articles about various topics, such as the legalization of marijuana in the US, or the most controversial movies of all time.
