<p>The “d-Dem” platform will track the emergence and diffusion of political topics both online (social media, news sites) and offline (newspaper feeds, press releases, parliamentary debates). We will identify the main issues in the political debates in Switzerland, extract the sentiment and key arguments the political actors voice towards these issues in the digital channels, estimate the communication networks among the actors, and compare the issue trends in the online debate to offline dynamics in parliamentary debates and traditional media. <br>

We will focus on the top-five media outlets of each canton and of the most important online news sources, such as 20 Minuten, as well as tweets from their official accounts. Finally, we will collect press releases and tweets from all available accounts based on a comprehensive list of politically relevant actors, as well as relevant hashtags. Our comprehensive sample of politically relevant actors consists of political parties, interest groups, federal and cantonal executives and parliaments as well as print media outlets, online news sites and TV stations. Federal and most cantonal administrations have centralized website services through which press releases and parliamentary debates are published and can be retrieved. Further, we have already compiled the list of parties from which we will retrieve press releases and tweets (those that have reached at least 5 percent of the votes in a canton in the 2015 federal elections). For the list of interest groups, we followed a a ’bottom-up approach’ and collected all names of organizations mentioned in the Swiss Yearbook of Public Life. We corroborated this list of interest group candidates with the information provided by the website verbaende.ch. Moreover, we checked whether the collected organizations appear in either the list of visitors of the Federal Assembly or the declarations of vested interests by members of the Federal Assembly. <br>

The analysis will produce two sets of outputs. First, we will visualize issue trends in the online and offline sources, with the ability for users to zoom in and out of the political agenda in the different arenas (social media, news media, TV, press releases, parliament speeches) and over time. Second, we will visualize the communication networks in various ways, using on patterns of interaction on social media but also by constructing affiliation networks linking organizations based on the amount of overlap in their language.</p>
