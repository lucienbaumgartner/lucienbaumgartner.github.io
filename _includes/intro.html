<p>The “d-Dem” platform will track the emergence and diffusion of political topics both online (social media, news sites) and offline (newspaper feeds, press releases, parliamentary debates). We will identify the main issues in the political debates in Switzerland, extract the sentiment and key arguments the political actors voice towards these issues in the digital channels, estimate the communication networks among the actors, and compare the issue trends in the online debate to offline dynamics in parliamentary debates and traditional media. <br>
The analysis will produce two sets of outputs. First, we will visualize issue trends in the online and offline sources, with the ability for users to zoom in and out of the political agenda in the different arenas (social media, news media, TV, press releases, parliament speeches) and over time. Second, we will visualize the communication networks in various ways, using on patterns of interaction on social media but also by constructing affiliation networks linking organizations based on the amount of overlap in their language.</p>
